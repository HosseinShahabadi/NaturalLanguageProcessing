# Natural Language Processing – Spring 2025

## 📚 Course Description

This repository contains personal notes, code, notebooks, and resources for the course **Natural Language Processing**, offered at **Sharif University of Technology** during **Spring 2025**.

The course covers both foundational and modern topics in NLP, ranging from classical linguistics-based methods to transformer-based deep learning models.

Main textbooks and references include:

* 📘 *Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. Draft)* by **Dan Jurafsky & James H. Martin**
* 🧠 *A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing* by **Yoav Goldberg**
* 📗 *Deep Learning* by **Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville**

Topics covered:

* Text preprocessing and linguistic structure
* Language modeling and word embeddings
* Syntactic and semantic parsing
* Sequence tagging (NER, POS)
* Transformer-based architectures (BERT, T5, etc.)
* Fine-tuning and prompt engineering
* Retrieval-based QA and structured data-to-text generation
* Evaluation metrics, error analysis, and human evaluation
